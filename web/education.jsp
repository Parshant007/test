<h3><b style="color:#FB3C10;"><u>NAYA SAVERA “CHILD EDUCATION THROUGH RADDI SE SHIKSHA”</u></b></h3>
<br>
<p>
  <u><b>  BACKGROUND</b></u><br>
Our NAYA SAVERA project aims to fulfill the dreams of poor innocent children who are deprived of the basic facilities. 
We wish to show them a better world filled with various opportunities for them. We provide knowledge and education to the poor children living in the slum areas.
We fulfill their needs by providing them free books, notebooks, stationery, bags, dresses, etc. we teach them through 
organizing special valuable programmes. Our special focus is working on girl’s education as their literacy rate when 
compared to boy is frequently less. We also focus on the reason behind school dropout and run various awareness
programmes on these issues.
</p><br>
<p><u><b>HOW WE WORK</b></u><br>
Our tutoring centres are operated in an open area. We will gather the children with the help of our volunteers in the targeted area. Our volunteers are capable of teaching the entire subject. We conduct regular tests on monthly basis to evaluate the improvement of the children. 
</p><br>

<p><u><b>LONG TERM IMPACTS</b></u><br>
The main problem in the Slum is illiteracy of girl child and the poverty. These problems create social 
evils like girl School dropouts, Street Children's and child labour. “Naya Savera” fulfill all needs of the children's
and spread awareness in children and parents which will lead to remove illiteracy, child labour, poverty etc and slum 
children would enjoy education. At present 40 children's in our targeted area are enjoying the benefits and we are 
looking forward to extend these educational services to another slum areas.
